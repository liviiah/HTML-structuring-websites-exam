                The Apple Lisa was introduced 40 years ago on January 19, 1983. Named after Steve Jobsâ€™ daughter, the first computer made by Apple, even though it was not nearly as successful as MacBooks today, it is the foundation from which all of them are built. It was the first personal computer to be designed with the GUI interface. The GUI interface made this computer accessible to a wider, more personal audience. It was sold at a price of $9,995. It has a Motorola 68000 CPU at 5 MHz and 1 MB of RAM. It was a simple computer used to perform basic operations. It has a display of 12 in and a mass of 48 lbs. Unfortunately, its operating system was too complex for its processor. The expensive cost paired with its design flaws made the computer relatively unpopular. It was almost immediately overshadowed by the 1984 Mac, which included the same features at a cheaper price. Only 10,000 units were sold before it was discontinued in 1985. The remainder of its inventory was buried in an Utah landfill for a tax write-off. It is widely considered a commercial failure. While the Lisa may not have achieved commercial success, its impact reverberates through the evolution of personal computing, reminding us of the importance of pioneering efforts in shaping the technological landscape we navigate today.
