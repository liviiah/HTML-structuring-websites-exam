            The release of the Mac II in 1987 was another groundbreaking moment in personal computer history. This product was unlike others because it introduced a modular design, which allowed for a customizable, expanded user experience. This was the first Mac to include color displays. Color displays were especially appealing to graphic designers and artists. This allowed for a wider audience and accurate color representation. The Mac II was significantly higher ranking in performance due to its Motorola 68020 processor. It was far more able to meet the needs of those looking for a complex computer program. Expansion slots allowed users to incorporate more peripherals and hardware components, making it much easier to access many applications. In both creative and professional environments, the Mac II rose in popularity, especially because of the ability to incorporate these third party hardwares. The Mac II could also support multiple monitors, allowing users to extend their desktop content to not only one but two screens! This provided a more efficient and immersive experience for users. The Mac II also allowed Apple to find its way into the business market. The sheer power and versatility made it stand out to businesses who were interested in strong, complex computing systems. This product skyrocketed Apple up to the top of their competition in the highly competitive personal computer market. The Mac II not only expanded the functions of personal computers worldwide, but also solidified Appleâ€™s spot as one of the top contenders in the competitive 1980s personal computer market.
