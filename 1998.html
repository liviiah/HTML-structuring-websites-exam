                The release of the IMac G3 in 1998 marked the comeback of Apple and a sudden rise in popularity. The computer was colorful and attractive unlike the previous designs. The beige box design was discarded for a translucent colorful casing. This Mac really showcased Jobs attention to design as it had a never seen before, attractive look. The IMac featured a 15 inch CRT display. It came in many vibrant colors which included Blue, Tangerine, and Grape. This was a part of Jobs plan aimed to make computers more user friendly by having an inviting and enticing design. One of the most unique features of this computer was its lack of a floppy disk drive, a controversial move considering the time. Jobs always believed in more modern, constantly improving technology, therefore he relied on upcoming USB technology and believed it would soon be very popular. The USB was also more convenient and efficient, easier for those who were not tech-savvy to use. Many were rightfully skeptical because not much was discovered in the USB tech realm, but Jobs was correct in his prediction and the IMac G3 became a huge hit. The IMac was important for Apple in a time in which they were not financially stable. Apple went through a period of low sales and low customer interest, but the IMacs vibrant and unique design attracted customers to purchase something they had never seen before. Two and a half decades later, the IMac still remains one of the most influential Apple products to date.
