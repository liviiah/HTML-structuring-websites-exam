            As the man who founded Apple in his parents garage, Steve Jobs is what most people would refer to as a genius. In 1978, Jobs made a proposal that shaped not only Apples success in the computing world, but the entire computing world itself for years to come. Jobs had a compelling vision which he presented to Apples co-founder Steve Wozniak and other coworkers. His idea exceeded the limits of any computer that had previously been created. He wanted to cater to a broader audience and make computers available to anyone who could afford them and would like to own one, not just professionals and experts. This proposal led to the groundbreaking Apple Macintosh introduced in 1984. His vision went far beyond the programming. He wanted to make the computer more friendly by incorporating a GUI (graphical user interface) and including a mouse. This laid the foundation for the successful company Apple is today and is the idea their widely known Macbooks stem from. Jobs believed technology should be accessible to everyone. He believed whoever would like to be connected to technology should be able to have access to it in their everyday lives. He made Apple one of the most successful PC companies to date. Jobs proposal in 1978 showcases his commitment to a more technologically advanced world and a forward thinking mindset. He was a charming, persuasive man that could, according to his employees, convince anyone to believe in his vision and refused to back down when challenges came his way. This is referred to as his “reality distortion field”.
