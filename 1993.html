            The Power Macintosh, introduced in 1993, was a huge step in Apples innovation process. This computer marked the transition from Motorola 68k processors to the RISC-based PowerPC architecture. This provided for a more enhanced and efficient user experience. This large change resulted from a collaboration with Apple, IBM, and Motorola. This is known as the AIM alliance. The Power Mac included the first PowerPc processors. These processors were significantly more powerful than the former 68k chips. A leap in technology allowed for higher performance and advanced multimedia capabilities. The initial models were the Power Mac 6100, Power Mac 7100, and Power Max 8100. The difference in these computers was the level of computing strength they allowed. They each catered to different specific user needs. This computer became a favorite of graphic designers, video editors, and many other creative artists who required a complex computing system. An innovative feature of the Power Mac is the tower like enclosure that would become a staple of Apple computers for years to come. The aesthetic design showed Apple’s commitment to an attractive, sleek design. The design also improved airflow, allowing for longer and more practical usage for users. The Power Mac is an excellent example of the innovation and dedication to aesthetics, hardware, and software that Apple showcases. The Power Mac architecture paved the way for many future Apple PCs such as the Power Mac G3, Power Mac G4 and later generations. This solidified even further Apple’s success and superiority in the PC market.
